/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 * A group of students are sitting in a circle. The teacher is electing a new
 * class president. The teacher does this by singing a song while walking around
 * the circle. After the song is finished the student at which the teacher
 * stopped is removed from the circle. Starting at the student next to the one
 * that was just removed, the teacher resumes singing and walking around the
 * circle. after the teacher is done singing, the next student is removed. The
 * teacher repeats this until only one student is left. A song of length k will
 * result in the teacher walking past k students on each round. The students are
 * numbered 1 to n. The teacher starts at student 1. For example, suppose the
 * song length is two (k=2). And there are four students to start with
 * (1,2,3,4). The first student to go would be �2�, after that �4�, and after
 * that ~3>. Student ~1� would be the next president in this example.
 * 
 * Signature:

 * public static int whoIsElected(int n, int k) { }
 * 
 * Test Cases: Input : 1, 1 Output :1
 * 
 * Input : 2, 2 Output :1
 * 
 * Input : 4, 2 Output :1
